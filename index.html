              At Jade Systems, we love to put technology to work to help people
              get their work done, learn, or simply enjoy their life. If you've

        We want to change your mind about custom software development. We want
        to show you that it can be low-risk, high-benefit, and frustration-free.
        There has never been a better time for technology to solve everyday
        problems.

        Jade Systems is me, Larry Reid. I've worked in the IT field since 1978,
        when I was paid to be a Unix v6 system administrator at the University
        of Saskatchewan. I've had my own start-up, worked as an employee, and
        contracted to such clients as Nortel, Cognos, Canada Post, BMW America,
        Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Australian Centre for Remote Sensing,
        HealthSouth, SourceMed, Vancouver Coastal Health, ICBC, Teck Resources,
        and BC Hydro.

      <p>
        I got a B. Sc. with High Honours in Computational Science from the
        University of Saskatchewan in 1980. From there, I wrote software for a
        few different companies, before joining the first personal computer
        revolution, writing software for the CP/M operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years I've been a programmer, architect, database
        administrator, system administrator. I was doing test driven development
        in the early nineties, before we even had the term. My system builds and
        deploys were automated -- what we now call DevOps. Later, I was a
        development director, and project manager, and branched into
        infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what motivates me most is simply to create systems that solve
        someone's problems. So I'm now focussing on programming again, primarily
        web applications, and primarily on Ruby on Rails. I'm open to contract
        opportunities or full-time employment.

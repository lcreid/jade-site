See an important update <a href="http://technopragmatica.blogspot.com/2011/03/debugging-windows-shares-and-samba.html">here</a>. The information that follows is still relevant to mount.cifs.<br /><br />With my current client, when I'm working at home, I have to connect to a CIFS share that uses Microsoft's DFS through their Cisco AnyConnect VPN. It seemed like the mount would work, but I couldn't see any of the files or folders below the share.&nbsp;(This is with Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx.)<br /><br />Fortunately, some other consultants working on the same project had the same problem, and they found a work-around. The work-around was to connect to the underlying server and folder, rather than through the DFS root.<br /><br />As my position with this client has evolved, I've needed to get to other folders on their file server, and I've occasionally had problems because I didn't know the underlying server and folder I needed to get to. So I continued to work on the problem. I think I've found the solution.<br /><br />I already had the keyutils package installed. You'll need it:<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">sudo apt-get install keyutils</span><br /><br />Then I added the following two lines to /etc/request-key.conf:<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">create<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>cifs.spnego<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>*<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>*<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>/usr/sbin/cifs.upcall %k %d</span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">create &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dns_resolver<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>*<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>*<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>/usr/sbin/cifs.upcall %k</span><br /><div><br /></div><div>Now I can connect to the DFS root if I use a mount command in a Terminal window.<br /><br /><br />sudo mount -t cifs --verbose -o user=my_domain/my_user_id //my_server/my_share /mnt<br /><div><br /></div><br />It still doesn't work if I try to connect to the share with Nautilus.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>(A quick check of a VM of 11.04 alpha 2 that I had lying around shows the above two lines are already in /etc/request-key.conf.)</div><div><br /></div><div>I haven't been using the fix for a long time, yet, so I don't know if it's the complete solution. I've noticed so far that sometimes Nautilus times out and doesn't get the file and folder list from the share. When I refresh the view in Nautilus it works fine.<br /><br />One of the key hints to find the solution was this text in my dmesg log:<br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'DejaVu Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"></span><br /><pre class="bz_comment_text" style="font-family: monospace; font-size: medium; white-space: pre-wrap; width: 50em;">CIFS VFS: cifs_compose_mount_options: Failed to resolve server part of...</pre></div><div><br /></div><div>Note that it turned out to have nothing to do with the VPN. Also, it leaves open the mystery as to why the other consultants, who were using Windows Vista, I think, also had to use the same work-around.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>

So I had a weird problem -- suddenly my DHCP server stopped updating my DNS server when my main laptop that I use all the time renewed its DHCP lease. It seemed to be working fine for all other machines on my network.<br /><br />After much fooling around and some reading, I discovered in the middle of some document a statement that the DHCP server keeps track of whether it thinks it has updated the DNS server, to avoid one round trip when renewing a lease. This means that if the DHCP server thinks it has updated DNS, it won't try again and if the DNS server doesn't have that address, it'll never get it.<br /><br />Well, the DNS server will never get it until you do the following on the DHCP client machine to force a release of the lease:<pre>sudo dhclient -r</pre>Once you do that and then renew the lease again (e.g. disconnect and connect the network) everything is fine.

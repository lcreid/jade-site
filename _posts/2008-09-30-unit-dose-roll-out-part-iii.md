Another key element to our success: Bring candy to nurses. Not only do
you make nurses happy because they get candy, but you're also showing
that you understand their culture and are at least a little bit willing
to move yourself closer to it.  
  
Just make sure you don't buy only "granny candy". As project managers
and senior nurse educators, we tend to be closer to the end of our
career than to the beginning. Don't forget that a significant number of
nurses nowadays carry iPhones and have a huge number of friends on
Facebook.

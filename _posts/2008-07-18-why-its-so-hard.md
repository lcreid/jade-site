Why is providing reliable IT infrastructure so hard? Here's a good
example.  
  
There was a [fire in downtown Vancouver][1] this week that knocked out
power to a good part of downtown for up to three days. Angela noted that
the Internet was slow the day of the fire. I know there's a major
network hub in the area of the fire at Harbour Centre, and I suspected
that something had gone wrong there, despite all the precautions that
would have been taken. Now I have [proof][2].  
  
The fire knocked out power to the network hub, and the generator kicked
in as planned, but the Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services were sucking
so much water to fight the fire that the generator had to shut down
because it wasn't getting enough cooling water. Not only was that hard
to predict, it would have been really hard to test -- I suppose the Fire
Department would have loved an excuse to play with their hoses, but I'm
not sure the City would have wanted them to run a test that tried to use
up all the water in downtown Vancouver.

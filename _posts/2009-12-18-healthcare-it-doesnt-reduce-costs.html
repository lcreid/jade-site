A <a href="http://www.amjmed.com/webfiles/images/journals/ajm/AJM10662S200.pdf">study</a> in the Harvard Medical Journal shows that healthcare IT doesn't reduce costs, and perhaps provides a very marginal increase in quality of care. The authors speculate that one of the reasons may be that the cost of obtaining and running the system outweighs the benefit. No kidding. That fits what I've seen completely.<br /><br />It's a short article, and worth reading. Thanks to <a href="http://thesoftwarelife.blogspot.com/">Andrew</a> for pointing me to it.

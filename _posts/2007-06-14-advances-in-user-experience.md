Here's [another interesting article][1] along the lines of, "How much
have computers advanced the user experience?" A 1986 Mac Plus beats an
AMD dual-core PC 9 tests to 8 over 17 different tests of Word and Excel
performance. The article is rather tongue in cheek, but the perspective
-- what does the user experience -- is one that we forget far too often.

  
One thing that's ignored in the article is that the Mac Plus cost you
way more money in absolute dollars. Never mind that a 1986 dollar bought
way more than a dollar today. Those that have written low-level code can
also appreciate how much more work it is to maintain 32 bits of colour
for each pixel, instead of one bit for the Mac's black and white
display. (Personally I'm still waiting for a Vista theme that looks like
a 1981 green screen monitor.)  
  
Does this post contradict what I said [here][2]? You be the judge.

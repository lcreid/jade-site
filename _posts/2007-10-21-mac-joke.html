I'm part-way through a <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail1867.html">podcast by Guy Kawasaki</a> where he recounts a joke the Apple II team had in the early days of the Macintosh: How many Mac team members does it take to screw in a light bulb? One: He just holds the light bulb and waits for the universe to revolve around him.<br /><br />The podcast is good, too. At least so far.

I've written lately about my struggles with sluggish Ubuntu and Mint
desktops. Finally, I discovered that [Chrome was the problem][1]{:
target="_blank"}. At one point in my ramblings, I recommended [using
Mate instead of Cinnamon][2]{: target="_blank"}. Well, I'm happy to
report that my slow Dell Vostro 1440 runs Cinnamon just fine, as long as
I'm not running Chrome.

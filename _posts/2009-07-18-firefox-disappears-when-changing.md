After a year without problems, suddenly I started having a problem where
Firefox disappeared when I switched between the laptop screen and my
external monitor. Firefox was still running, but I couldn't make it
appear.  
  
It turns out that somehow it was ending up on outside the screen and
therefore it wasn't being shown on the bottom panel. Here's how to fix: 

  
<ol><li>Right click on the bottom panel ("task bar" in Windows talk) and
select "Preferences".  
</li><li>Select "Show windows from all workspaces". Then the Firefox
button will at least appear on the bottom panel.  
</li><li>If you can't see the window, right click on its button in the
bottom panel and click "Move". Then you can pull the window onto the
current display and click again to drop it there.</li></ol>

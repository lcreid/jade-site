Linux is 20 years old this year, and Linuxcon was in Vancouver, so I had
to sign up. The conference ended yesterday. There were a lot of good
speakers. As a bonus, we also got to hear some poor guy from HP give a
keynote about HP's great WebOS play, at almost exactly the same time as
his company was killing the product line.  
  
What I was looking for, frankly, was a business opportunity for a small
consultant/system integrator like [Jade Systems][1] to use Linux to help
businesses with 1,000 servers, give or take a zero at the end. The most
obvious opportunity I came away with is storage.  
  
I've written before about the [cost of enterprise storage][2]. There are
tremendous opportunities with hardware solutions like [Backblaze][3]'s
storage bricks, and the software that will make it all work is
[Gluster][4]. Install Gluster on a couple of boxes with storage, and you
have synchronous replication (locally) or asynchronous replication (over
the WAN). It provides what you need to store your virtual machines and
move them around your data centre as load or availability needs dictate.
It can be your large, reliable, network attached storage device for all
your spreadsheets and documents.  
  
Gluster grew out of the needs of a supercomputing project at Lawrence
Livermore Labs in 2004 and have an impressive list of users today.
They're working to integrate with the [OpenStack][5] cloud computing
stack to provide a complete cloud storage solution for <span

This is certainly a solution that could support a business case.

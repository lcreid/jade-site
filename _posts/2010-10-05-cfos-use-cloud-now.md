It occurred to me that there's an easy way for CFOs and CEOs to use the
cloud right now, without waiting for the IT department to touch a single
piece of equipment. Here's how:  
  
Ask your IT department how many servers and how much data you have. (Ask
how much data is actually being used, not how much capacity you have.)
Then, go to[ Amazon's site for cloud services][1] and calculate how much
it would cost to host that on Amazon. Finally, call in the CIO and ask
her why your IT infrastructure budget is a lot higher than what it would
cost to host on Amazon. It will be. You're asking for the whole
infrastructure budget, not just the cost of the equipment.  
  
For example, suppose you have 460 Windows servers and 200 TBs of data.
Amazon has different prices for different size servers, but start by
assuming all your servers are what Amazon calls "large". Your annual
cost for that (October, 2010) is $2.5M. That includes 400 Mbps of
network traffic into and out of the data centre 24 hours per day.  
  
Ask your CIO out what services you're getting that justify the premium
you pay for having an in-house IT infrastructure department.  
  
In reality, you're CIO's no dummy. She'll be able to give you a pretty
good story about why the IT infrastructure budget is so much. That's
when you can use an [independent IT consultant][2] who's not owned by a
company selling the infrastructure that drives up your costs. The real
value comes when you start to use the benchmark cost of Amazon to
identify and drive improvements in the value provided by your
infrastructure department.  
  
For example, when your CIO is talking about the services she provides,
ask her when she's going to offer servers that can be spun up by a user,
through a web site, with no intervention at all from the IT
infrastructure group, like on Amazon? Or when the business will be able
to downsize how much it's paying if it discovers that it doesn't need a
large server, like on Amazon? Or when you'll start paying only for the
data storage you're using, and not for a bunch of empty disk that you
had to buy for "future growth", like on Amazon?  
  
And that's how to use the cloud without changing one piece of
technology.

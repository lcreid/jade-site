My son is fascinated with videos. I dream that one day he'll get fascinated by making them, not just watching them. So I've been trying to learn about making videos. Here's what I had to reinstall on my new computer.<div><br /></div><div>First, playing video (and audio, for that matter) has worked out of the box much better with 11.04 than with previous versions of Ubuntu. I play my Guatemalan radio station and CBC audio and video without having to fool around with any setup.</div><div><br /></div><div>To make videos, I loaded up OpenShot.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>sudo apt-get install openshot</div><div><br /></div><div>That didn't install ffmpeg, which has been my main fallback tool. It seems to be the tool that does everything, although as a command line tool, I find I usually just cut and paste an example command line from the Internet. It's not that I'm afraid of the Linux command line. It's that I don't know anything about video. So:</div><div><br /></div><div>sudo apt-get install ffmpeg</div><div><br /></div><div>That seems to be all that was needed.</div>

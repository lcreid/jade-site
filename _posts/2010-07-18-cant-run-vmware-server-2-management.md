| I filled the disk on my VMWare Server 2 host, which caused all sorts of grief. Part of the grief was that I couldn't get to the management interface at https://vmhost:8333/ui. I solved that problem by killing the VMWare hostd process (after freeing up some space on the disk):   
<ol><li>Look up the process ID: ps -ea | grep hostd</li><li>Kill the process: sudo kill *pid*Â </li><li>Remove the old lock file: sudo rm /var/run/vmware/vmware-hostd.PID</li><li>Restart VMWare management: sudo /etc/init.d/vmware-mgmt restart </li></ol> |

As of about three weeks ago I'm using Linux Mint 13 with the Cinnamon
desktop. I don't even know what half of that means. I'm just doing what
comes up by default. It's nice to be back to a desktop that works for
content producers -- not that I produce that much content.  
  
\[Edit: Cinnamon runs fine on a low-powered computer like a Dell Vostro
1440, but [don't try to use Chrome][1]{: target="_blank"}.\]

Anne Thomas Manes published a great <a href="http://apsblog.burtongroup.com/2009/01/soa-is-dead-long-live-services.html">post</a> about how the economic downturn means the end of big IT projects being done for some vaguely defined "value". There's a good podcast about it <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4004.html">here</a>.<br /><br />I think the key messages are:<br /><ul><li>IT can provide spectacular gains in business value only by transforming the IT department (people, processes and technology), not by changing the interface engine between the same set of disparate applications</li><li>SOA is dead not because the technology is necessarily wrong, but because business aren't going to spend money on projects that don't provide immediate business value</li><li>IT provides value by understanding the business and providing what the business needs. That's not a simple process and is fraught with political minefields within and outside the IT department<br /></li></ul>There's a great bit starting at minute 28:00 where she says, "Go take a look at the SOA success stories and invariably there's a new CIO in place. And it only happens because the CEO recognizes that he needs to fix IT, and he knows his current CIO isn't fixing it."

I'm looking for an open source friendly accounting company to do my
taxes and give me advice. The only reason I need a Windows box anymore
is to do my accounting, since most accountants want their clients to use
Windows-based software.  
  
I typed something into Google to see if I could find an accounting firm
that was open source friendly. I got one of those bogus pages that's
just scraped together from bits of the internet by a computer program.
Sleaze-balls put up sites like this to try to get you to land there from
a search and then click on a link, generating ad revenue for the
sleaze-ball.  
  
The thing was, it took me a few moments to realize the page for what it
was. It almost looked like a real site dedicated to open source
accounting software. I thought, "wow, this sleaze-ball software is
getting pretty good."  
  
The I realized that it could also be that so many sites on the Internet
are still so bad, that a computer can do as good a job as a person.  
  
(Is this a variant of the [Turing Test][1]?)

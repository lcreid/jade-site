I had a bizarre failure in some test cases. The test case looked like this:<pre>marker = Time.now<br />t.create(args)<br />assert t.created_at.between?(marker, Time.now)</pre>In other words, take the time, create an object, and make sure it was created between the first time and now. Obviously true, but my test was failing.<br /><br />The reason: Rails keeps the create time to the second, but Ruby keeps time to fractions of a second (depending on the resolution of your hardware clock). Both would have the same time (to the second) but the marker would have some microseconds more than t.created_at, so the assertion would fail.<br /><br />The Ruby documentation actually warns you about this, but in way that's cryptic enough that it might not be obvious why your simple test case is failing in such a bizarre way.<br /><br />The solution? Mine was make the time an integer and convert it back to a time using Time.at:<br /><pre>marker = Time.at(Time.now.to_i)<br />t.create(args)<br />assert t.created_at.between?(marker, Time.now)</pre>This doesn't really merit a blog post, except that I Googled for solutions to the problem and didn't find much.

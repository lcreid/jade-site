A [study][1] in the Harvard Medical Journal shows that healthcare IT
doesn't reduce costs, and perhaps provides a very marginal increase in
quality of care. The authors speculate that one of the reasons may be
that the cost of obtaining and running the system outweighs the benefit.
No kidding. That fits what I've seen completely.  
  
It's a short article, and worth reading. Thanks to [Andrew][2] for
pointing me to it.

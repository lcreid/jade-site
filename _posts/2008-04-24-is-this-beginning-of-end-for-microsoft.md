...or... The end of the... or whatever.  
  
[Here][1] you can read about Microsoft explaining their Health Vault
product (sorry, I think you might need to register). "<span
class="Article_Date"><span class="Article_Date"><span class="txt">We're
coining a new term, the Unified Intelligence system." I think experience
in IT shows that if you have to "coin a new term" you're selling
something that no one wants. Is [Tim Bray right][2], that the options to
Microsoft are here "right now" and we could be seeing the start of a big
change?

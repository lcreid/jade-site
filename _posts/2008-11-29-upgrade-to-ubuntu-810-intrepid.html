I upgraded my laptop (<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Lenovo</span> x300) to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Ubuntu</span> 8.10 a few weeks ago. The rumour was that power management was better, and I was longing for a kernel that handled the sound on the x300 without a re-compile of the driver every time I updated the kernel.<br /><br />The upgrade went smoothly, although it took a very long time. The default <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Ubuntu</span> mirror for Canada seems to be very slow these days. (I've since switched to<span style="font-family:courier new;"> http://gpl.savoirfairelinux.net/pub/mirrors/ubuntu</span>. It seems a lot faster.)<br /><br />Two things I've had to work on. First, suspend and resume screws up the wireless until you add a line to <span style="font-family:courier new;">/etc/pm/config.d/00sleep_module</span>. First, you have to figure out which driver you're using for wireless. Do<br /><blockquote style="font-family: courier new;"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">lshw</span> | more<br /></blockquote>Look for the line that says "wireless" by typing "/wireless" to the more prompt. Then look for the next line with "driver" in it. In my case it says "driver=<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">iwlagn</span>". So now edit the file and add the required line:<br /><blockquote style="font-family: courier new;"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">sudo</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">gedit</span> /etc/pm/config.d/00sleep_module<br /></blockquote>Add the following at the very end:<br /><blockquote style="font-family: courier new;">SUSPEND_MODULES="<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">iwlagn</span>"<br /></blockquote>The other problem was more mysterious. CBC Radio's website wouldn't play after upgrading to 8.10. It had worked for my in 8.04 after some fooling around, but I couldn't get it to work. I had given up after wasting almost a whole day on the problem. After a few software upgrades, it started to work. For the record, I'm using gnome-<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">mplayer</span> to play Windows Media Player material.

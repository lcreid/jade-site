The Parent Advisory Council (PAC) website is live at <a href="http://hastingspac.ca/">http://hastingspac.ca/</a> and is in a relatively stable form. Much work remains on the translations, but the bones of the site are there and it's up to everyone else to put up the content (muscle).<br /><br />I think we've got a pretty good site for a volunteer group. Our goal is to increase participation in the PAC to benefit the education of our children.<br /><br />I'll be posting more about the technology behind the site (<a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> and content management systems) this morning.<br /><br />I'd love to hear comments and ideas you might have about the site.

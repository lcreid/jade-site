I gave a lightning talk at the Ubuntu Vancouver Local Committee July 9, 2009 on accessing the Internet from an Ubuntu computer through the iPhone.<br /><ul><li>Use the instructions from the Ubuntu forums <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1195655">here</a>. <a href="http://xn--9bi.net/2009/06/17/tethering-iphone-3-0-to-ubuntu-9-04/">This other page</a> gives the underlying commands used by the script from the Ubuntu forum. You may find it helpful if the script doesn't work for you.</li><li>During installation, when you're asked to make the iPhone discoverable, go to Settings-&gt; General-&gt; Bluetooth and turn on Bluetooth.</li><li>Part way through the instructions in the Ubuntu forum you're asked to "pair" your iPhone with the computer. To "pair" your iPhone with your computer:</li></ul><ol><li>Click on the blue icon with white triangles that you'll find amount the other notification icons, typically in the upper-right corner of your screen.</li><li>Select "Set up new device..."</li><li>Click "Forward".</li><li>Wait for your iPhone to appear in the list. If it doesn't, go back to Settings-&gt; General-&gt; Bluetooth on the iPhone and make sure Bluetooth is on. Also, make sure your iPhone is less than a 1/2 metre from your computer.</li><li>Select your iPhone in the list and click "Forward".</li><li>Ubuntu will show you a four-digit code and ask you to enter it on the device. The iPhone will have a keypad showing. Enter the code.</li><li>Ubuntu will ask if you want to allow the connection. Select "Always allow" and click "OK".</li><li>You're now paired.</li></ol><ul><li>Before trying to tether your computer to the iPhone, go back to Settings-&gt; General-&gt; Bluetooth. Your computer's name with "-0" appended should appear below the on/off button. If it says "Not connected" beside your computer's name, click on the computer name and wait for it to change to "Connected".</li><li>Using Network Manager, turn off other network connections you may have running before tethering.<br /></li><li>Finally, before running the script, don't forget to turn on Internet Tethering on the iPhone. Go to Settings-&gt; General-&gt; Network-&gt; Internet Tethering and turn Internet Tethering on.</li><li>Keep the iPhone with 1/2 metre of your computer. (You can try more, but I suspect that the flaky connection I sometimes experience may be associated with the distance between the phone and the computer.)</li><li>After running the script, you still won't be able to browse the Internet. (You don't have any usable DNS servers defined on your computer.) Do the following in a terminal:</li></ul>sudo cat &gt;&gt;/etc/resolv.conf &lt;&lt;-END     nameserver 208.67.220.220     nameserver 208.67.222.222     END <br /><ul><li>I put the above in my uit.sh script at the appropriate place.</li> <li>Remember to turn off Internet Tethering and Bluetooth on the iPhone when you're done.</li> <li>Disconnect tethering on your computer by running: sudo ./uit.sh -d<br /></li> <li>Don't forget to reconnect your computer to your usual networks after you turn off tethering.<br /></li> </ul>Troubleshooting<br /><ul><li>My experience is that you have to do everything in exactly the right order. If something goes wrong, do the following and then start over:</li></ul><ol><li>On the iPhone, go to Settings-&gt; General-&gt; Network-&gt; Internet Tethering and turn Internet Tethering off.</li><li>On the iPhone, go to Settings-&gt; General-&gt; Network-&gt; Bluetooth and turn Bluetooth off</li><li>On your computer, run the disconnect script: sudo ./uit.sh -d</li><li>On your computer, restart Bluetooth: sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart</li></ol><ul><li>The Bluetooth connection seems to be unreliable. Sometimes I can browse a page or two and then it stops working. Sometimes it just doesn't connect at all. After two or three tries I usually get a reliable connection. Every time it fails, be sure to do all the steps in the above list.</li></ul>

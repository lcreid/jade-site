There's no such thing as a dry run when you're moving a data centre. That may not seem sensible. But here's why. I think it's easiest to explain in one sentence:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If you do a dry run, moving a computer to a different data centre, and it works, why would you move it back? </blockquote><br />If that still doesn't make sense, think back to the days when moving a computer included a physical activity: unplugging the computer, putting it on a truck, and shipping it to your new data centre. Would you really propose that you do a dry run of that, then, if your dry run succeeds, putting it back on a truck, moving it back to the old data centre, getting it running again, only to then do it "for real" some time later?<br /><br />Granted, in the world of virtual computers, you don't have to actually move the computer back. However, there is still a list of activities you have to do to move a virtual computer, that you have to undo. There's just as much a chance you'll screw up the undoing of those steps, as there is that you'll screw up the doing of them in the first place. A dry run actually increases the overall risk of the relocation.<br /><br /><ol></ol>

When I read my previous post, I got the feeling that I was saying you
needed an objectively measurable financial benefit in order to justify
using SAN-attached storage. All my experience in IT has shown that you
make no progress if you wait for <span style="font-style:
italic;">all</span> the questions to be answered. So reading my post got
me thinking, how do I decide when I have enough information to move
forward?  
  
That reminded me of another recent project I led, where we set up a
VMWare farm, then over the course of half a year virtualized over 130
physical servers and created about 70 new virtual servers. With minimal
research we had established that VMs were C$380 per month cheaper, based
on hard, quantifiable data (floor space lease, power consumption, server
lease, and server maintenance). That's a savings of C$76,000 per month. 

  
On top of that, you have all the harder to quantify benefits that the
VMWare sales reps will tell you about: faster deployment, higher
availability, etc. The nice thing is, you don't need to count those up
when you have such an obvious measurable benefit. If fact, even if we
had discovered that server management effort had gone up, we could have
got another server admin for almost a year (fully loaded cost) for what
we saved in a month by virtualizing.  
  
A lot of what we deal with in IT seems to lean in the other direction:
The easy-to-count numbers actually argue against a new approach. The
value has to be in the intangible benefits. What I'm exploring with the
SAN storage case is how to deal with intangible value.

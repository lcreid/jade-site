So today I had to participate in one of the many little rituals of an
enterprise IT project manager: Get someone signed up to my project time
charge code.  
  
I submitted the usual paperwork like I've done a number of times before,
but this time I was told that the role I selected wasn't a role in the
timesheet software, and neither was the individual's official job title.
The individual is an employee of the client's company.  
  
I felt somewhat smug that I was able to completely ignore the absurdity
that an employee's job title isn't acceptable to the company's timesheet
software. But then I realized what I was being asked to do: I had been
told two titles that weren't acceptable to the timesheet system, but I
had not been told what would be acceptable. I guess I'm supposed to
randomly guess until I get the right answer.  
  
Definitely a [Dilbert][1]{: target="_blank"} moment. But then I asked
myself, "Why would someone respond to me this way?" The person I was
dealing with is a very nice, dedicated worker. They weren't just trying
to make my life difficult.   
  
I think it's because, in the enterprise IT world, there's no upside to
providing service. An IT manager has too many demands, and not enough
people to meet the demands. In addition, the path to promotion for the
manager is through more responsibility, and the way to get that is by
having more staff and a bigger budget. If you provide good service for
the same personnel level, you're not meeting your boss's needs.  
  
Also, there's no upside to taking responsibility. If you take
responsibility, you can be blamed if, sometimes, you don't achieve the
desired result. Better to leave all decisions up to someone else, and
don't give them any help, in case they blame you if your help turns out
not to be helpful.   
  
This culture so permeates our business that it's not absurd to just tell
someone, "You got it wrong," without giving so much as a hint as to what
the right answer might be.  
  
No wonder people have such low expectations of IT.

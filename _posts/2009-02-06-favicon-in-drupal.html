I'm using <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> to put together a <a href="http://hastingspac.jadesystems.ca/">site</a> for my son's school's Parent Advisory Committee (PAC). I'm impressed at how quickly you can get something up on Drupal. Getting something the way you want it is a little harder, as is always the case with computers.<br /><br />One stumbling block has been the favicon. First, it appears that the HTML that Drupal generates requires a Windows Icon file type (favicon.ico). I've used favicon.png in other sites, but in Drupal it has to be a .ico file.<br /><br />Also, the directory where you put the favicon.ico is write protected, and the file manager I was using on my hosted service didn't tell me I was trying to upload a file to a write protected directory. That resulted in another 10 minutes of muttering and fooling around trying to figure out where the file was going.

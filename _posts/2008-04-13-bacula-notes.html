The <a href="http://www.bacula.org/en/rel-manual/Bacula_Users_Guide.html">Bacula documentation</a> is good, but given the complex and interdependent nature of the backup problem, it's pretty overwhelming at first.<br /><br />One thing that's not immediately obvious is where the configuration files are. The <span style="font-family: courier new;">bacula-fd.conf</span> file for Windows XP clients is at <span style="font-family: courier new;">C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\bacula\bacula-fd.conf</span>. On Ubuntu using the packages installed from universe, the configuration files are in <span style="font-family: courier new;">/etc/bacula</span>.<br /><br />If you get errors that the server can't connect to the client, make sure the director definition in the client's <span style="font-family: courier new;">bacula-fd.conf</span> allows the director to connect, and that the client's password matches the server's password in the client resource of <span style="font-family: courier new;">/etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf</span>. There's a <a href="http://www.bacula.org/en/rel-manual/Bacula_Freque_Asked_Questi.html#SECTION003760000000000000000">helpful picture</a> of what you need to do in the Bacula documentation.

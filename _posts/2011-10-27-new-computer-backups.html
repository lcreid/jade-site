I'd love to find a new backup solution, but the reality is I have Bacula working reasonably consistently right now, and it's the easiest thing to get set up quickly. So I:<br /><ol><li>Installed bacula-client and bacula-traymonitor packages (sudo apt-get install bacula-client bacula-traymonitor)</li><li>Copied /etc/bacula/bacula-fd.conf and /etc/bacula/tray-monitor.conf from the old laptop</li><li>Changed the host name in both the above files</li><li>Added my new laptop to /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf on the bacula director host by copying the job definition of the old laptop and renaming it</li></ol>

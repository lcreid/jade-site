The Canadian Internet Registration Association (<a href="http://www.cira.ca">CIRA</a>) sent me an e-mail telling me that they were <a href="http://communications.cira.ca/en/Whois/whois_intro.html">changing the "whois" data</a> so they don't give out personal information of domain owners. Thunderbird thought it was a scam e-mail.

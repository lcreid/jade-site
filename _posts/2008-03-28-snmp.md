The basic VM needs to have SNMP running on it, because there's no point
having a server if you're not monitoring it. I had [Zenoss][1] set up a
year ago monitoring some of my computers, but I was getting "bad oid"
messages on the new VM template I was setting up.  
  
The solution: Zenoss had a default SNMP version of 1 for Linux systems.
I had set up SNMP on the new VM for version 2c. In Zenoss 2.0 I
navigated to <span style="font-family: courier
new;">/Devices/Server/Linux</span> page and selected the <span
style="font-family: courier new;">zProperties</span> tab, then scrolled
down to <span style="font-family: courier new;">zSnmpVer</span> and set
it to <span style="font-family: courier new;">v2c</span>.

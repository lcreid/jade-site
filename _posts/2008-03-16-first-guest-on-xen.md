I created a Debian 3.1 VM from the templates using XenCenter. I just
followed the XenCenter wizard. It was trivial, although before I created
it I spent almost 1 1/2 hours reading documentation and the Internet.  
  
The only thing I had to do was set the time zone. Being old fashioned, I
used the command line console and <span style="font-family: courier

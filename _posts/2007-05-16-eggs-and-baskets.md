One of the patterns I've seen over the years is how IT and technology in
general magnifies the consequences of poor performance. We put
everything on one storage device so it's easy to manage, but it's also
easy to type "drop table..." in the production database. It's also very
hard to get the backup just right, and harder still to be able to test
restores of a production backup.  
  
As an IT manager, you need to mitigate for this. Do reviews,
walkthroughs, or whatever you want to call it to ensure that at least
two pairs of eyes have evaluated your designs. Do as much testing as
possible. Fight for more budget for testing. Build the simplest possible
solution that meets your needs.   
  
Another thing you can do is subscribe to the [comp.risks RSS feed][1]
and read all the different ways that the best laid plans can be derailed
by one little mistake.

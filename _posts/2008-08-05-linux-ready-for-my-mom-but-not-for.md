I think Ubuntu 8.04 is ready for anyone who wants a good desktop
computer with a decent set of office productivity tools. The
installation and update experience with Ubuntu is as good or better than
Windows and Open Office does what the vast majority of ordinary users
need it to do. My mother is using Ubuntu for e-mail and web surfing and
having no problems (beyond what she'd have with Windows seeing as how
she's never used a computer before).   
  
Where I'm getting blocked is when I want to do the power-user type
things: e.g. sync to a PDA that only has Windows Mobile 2003 on it or
use cutting edge devices like a Lenovo x300. That's when I find I have
to go to Linux Geek Land. At least I'm only recompiling modules, and not
the whole kernel :-)  
  
So in that sense, Linux is ready for the average person's desktop, it's
just not ready for us geeks yet.

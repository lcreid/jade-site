Four years ago I went to Linuxcon NA 2011. The unspoken mood of the
conference seemed to be, "Linux has won the OS wars, but the rest of the
world hasn't noticed." At [Linuxcon NA 2015][1]{: target="_blank"}, the
unspoken mood of the conference was, "It doesn't matter who won the OS
wars."  
  
Some big markers of that:  
  
<ul><li>IBM announcing [LinuxOne][2]{: target="_blank"}, an offering for
people who want to buy Z series mainframes to run
Linux</li><li>Microsoft giving out soft squishy Tux penguins with a
Microsoft URL on them, and stickers that said,
"Microsoft [![](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSY_grx0eyZzD3y6T0es4o5xCZeoLaiwd_ks-rj-clzNA3I7BCH){:

Linux"</span></li><li><span style="text-align: center;">Only one joke
about 2015 being the year of the Linux desktop</span></li></ul>

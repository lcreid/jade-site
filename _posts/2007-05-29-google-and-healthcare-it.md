[Google is showing interest][1] in becoming the provider of people's
electronic health record. It's an interesting idea, but the
ramifications of the U.S. Patriot Act are probably unacceptable to the
vast majority of people who think about the privacy of their health
record.  
  
Basically, the Patriot Act gives the U.S. Government the right to look
at any data in any computer in the United States, and they don't have to
tell anyone they're looking at it. In fact, it's a crime to tell anyone
their data was looked at. This basically violates any privacy
legislation in any country that has such a thing. You need to give
permission to anyone to look at your data, and you need to be informed
if someone looks at your data for any reason.  
  
In healthcare IT here in Canada we now live with the fact that
healthcare data about Canadians can't be stored in or even pass through
the United States. At least we can build an electronic health record. We
just have to keep the data in Canada. Thanks to the Patriot Act,
Americans may miss out on a great chance to improve their health.  
  
(There might be an opportunity for enterprising Canadians to host the
U.S. electronic health record, but if I recall correctly HIPAA says you
can't store U.S. healthcare data outside the U.S.)

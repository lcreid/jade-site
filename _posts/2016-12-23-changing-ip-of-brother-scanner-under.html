<p>We had a power outage this week. Some devices on my home network got new IP addresses when the power came back on. One of the devices that got a new IP address was my Brother MFC-9340CDW printer/scanner/fax. The printer was still working fine, but I couldn’t scan.</p> <p>The tl;dr is to remove the old configuration and set the new one:</p> <pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> brsaneconfig4 -r MFC-<span class="hljs-number">9340</span>CDW<br /><span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> brsaneconfig4 <span class="hljs-operator">-a</span> name=MFC-<span class="hljs-number">9340</span>CDW model=MFC-<span class="hljs-number">9340</span>CDW ip=<span class="hljs-number">192.168</span>.<span class="hljs-number">0.124</span></code></pre> <p>I got the new IP address from poking buttons on the front panel of the printer. <br>The name of the device may be different, but the above is what I had from the default setup. <br><code>brsaneconfig4 -q</code> gives all the devices supported, and also the last line is the current configuration. <br>That’s useful to see what the currently configured IP address is, according to the software on the computer.</p> <p>To figure out what was wrong with <code>simple-scan</code>, I did this in a terminal to see debugging output:</p> <pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs lasso">simple<span class="hljs-attribute">-scan</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">-d</span></code></pre> <p>Another useful command is:</p>   <pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs lasso">brsaneconfig4 <span class="hljs-attribute">-p</span></code></pre> <p>which runs <code>ping</code> on the scanner. However, in my case another device had the scanner’s old IP address, <br>so the <code>ping</code> appeared to be working fine.</p>

From time to time I need to access a Windows share on a domain (not is a local work group) via Nautilus (the LinuxMint file browser I use). It always takes me too long to figure out the trick...<br /><br />The trick: The domain has to be specified in upper case (or perhaps it's simply case sensitive and it depends how the domain administrator has specified the domain). So in Nautilus, I do File-&gt; Connect to Server..., then fill in the appropriate values in the dialogue that appears, with domain in upper case.<br /><br />To debug issues when connecting to Windows shares, I open a Terminal window and type:<br /><br />smbclient -U <i>domain</i>\\<i>windows_user_name</i> //<i>windows_server_name</i>/<i>share</i><br /><br />and follow the prompts.<br /><br />If that works, I try:<br /><br />gvfs-mount "smb://<i>domain</i>;<i>windows_user_name</i>@<i>windows_server_name</i>/<i>share</i>"<br /><br />and follow the prompts. (The quotes are required because the semi-colon is a special character to the Terminal program.) I have seen cases where the mount takes a minute or so to connect, so I have to be patient.<br /><br />If the above works, I unmount the drive with:<br /><br />gvfs-mount -u "smb://<i>domain</i>;<i>windows_user_name</i>@<i>windows_server_name</i>/<i>share</i>"<br /><br />

I'm using [TikiWiki][1] to propose to [REACH Community Health Centre][2]
an idea about prescribing guidelines. I tried adding the search module.
It would appear for the admin user but not for anyone else.  
  
It turns out there is also a permission to allow users or groups to
search. The module doesn't display unless you enable search for the
users or groups. Judging by the name of some of the other permissions,
there may be other modules that also require a permission to be set.

I'm back to doing a bit of Rails. As always, the world has moved on.
Rails is at 4.0.2, and Ruby 2.0 is out. The Rails folks are recommending
[rbenv][1]{: target="_blank"} to manage different Ruby versions and
their gems. I knew I still had some learning to do to be using
[rvm][2]{: target="_blank"} properly, so I decided to invest the
learning time in learning rbenv, since that's what the mainstream was
using.  
  
First, I had to remove the lines at the end of my ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile,
and ~/.bash\_profile, and restart all my terminal windows.   
  
I followed the rbenv installation instructions here:
[https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#installation][3], including the
optional [ruby-build installation][4]{: target="_blank"}.  
  
Then, I did:  
  
rbenv install -l  
  
that shows 2.0.0-p353 as the newest production version of MRI. So I did:

  
rbenv install 2.0.0-p353  
rbenv rehash # Either this or the next was necessary to avoid trying to
install Rails in the system gem directories.  
rbenv global 2.0.0-p353   
gem install rails  
rbenv rehash # Don't forget this again  
  
Now I was ready to test a new application:   
  
rails new example  
cd example  
rails server  
  
Then I pointed a browser to: http://localhost:3000, and voil√†.  
  
I'm not sure I want to leave the rbenv global in place...

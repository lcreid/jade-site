I like the web site the [Terry Fox Foundation][1] has put together for
their annual school run to raise funds for cancer research. It lets
people donate on-line, of course. Much more interesting is that it lets
kids collect and create their own content -- photos and videos -- and
post them on their own page, along with a graph showing how close to
reaching their fund-raising goal they are.  
  
My son Marc got right into making videos for it. For the Foundation, it
gets kids thinking and talking about Terry Fox and the importance of
cancer research. For the kids, it gets them producing content for the
web. The future belongs to those who produce content. (Those of us who
produce the technology will be like the guys today who keep the
mainframes running.)  
  
Shameless commercial: You can contribute to cancer research by
supporting Marc's run [here][2].

I wanted to continue to use Ubuntu Server in my VMs. I like their
approach to long-term support, the server install, and the way they
provide a pre-configured LAMP server.  
  
As I read about how to build one, I stumbled across [a post][1] from
someone else who was doing what I wanted to do, and had problems. That
scared me off just blindly stumbling ahead, so now I have more research
to do.  
  
I'm pretty sure it should be relatively easy to have a kernel that works
on top of Xen, and on which I can run an otherwise standard Ubuntu 6.06
install, but it's going to take some digging... This is harder than I
wanted it to be.

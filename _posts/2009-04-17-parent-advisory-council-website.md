The Parent Advisory Council (PAC) website is live at
[http://hastingspac.ca/][1] and is in a relatively stable form. Much
work remains on the translations, but the bones of the site are there
and it's up to everyone else to put up the content (muscle).  
  
I think we've got a pretty good site for a volunteer group. Our goal is
to increase participation in the PAC to benefit the education of our
children.  
  
I'll be posting more about the technology behind the site ([Drupal][2]
and content management systems) this morning.  
  
I'd love to hear comments and ideas you might have about the site.

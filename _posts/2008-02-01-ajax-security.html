It seems like every time I get to the point where I think I might get excited about writing a web application, I listen to a <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail3516.html">podcast about the abysmal state of security</a> on the Wild West Web. The technology has to be made secure. We can't rely on programmers to do the right thing because we're human and we'll mess it up from time to time.

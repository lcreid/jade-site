My friend [Elena Murzello][1] just got her web site going. Elena is an
[actor][2] who's appeared as Anna in [The L Word][3], Tennat #1 in [Da
Vinci's Inquest][4], and a Nurse Educator in the [Vancouver Coastal
Health's][5] [Unit Dose Project][6], among other roles. (One of these
things is not like the other.)  
  
She asked me for hints about how to generate traffic to her web site. I
realized that I really should blog my thoughts, because other people
could comment and correct what I say. So the rest of this post is
written to Elena, but you can read it as if it's written to you.  
  
First, your site looks great. I'm really glad you have a blog on it, and
that you're writing new posts frequently. New posts generate traffic to
your site, and traffic to your site improves your ranking on search
engines. Write blog posts about what's important to you, and about your
experiences in the dramatic arts. Mention names: If you had a great
moment with [Nicholas Campbell][7] while filming for [Da Vinci][4], blog
that. The more names the better.  
  
(Let's face it, you'll get more traffic blogging about The L Word. Who
am I kidding. And a note to the regular technical readers of this blog:
The L Word is not a TV series about [Linux][8].)   
  
[Tumblr][9] looks like a great blog service. As usual, I learn something
from you. Thanks!   
  
Also, put links in your blog post, like I'm doing with this blog post.
It's a service to your readers, but it also generates traffic back to
your site. Think of it as if you get points when someone goes somewhere
popular because you pointed them there.  
  
Of course, make sure that all search engines are indexing your site, but
especially Google. You web site designer should have done this for you
already, but don't assume it was done. Ask.  
  
You're also absolutely doing the right thing by using Google Analytics
(or any kind of traffic measuring tool). If you decide to pay someone to
do some search engine optimization on your site, you need to have
baseline data on how well your traffic was growing just from your own
efforts. No point in paying someone for growth that you generated by
yourself.  
  
Next get on Twitter (Update: Elena's at [@ElenaMurzello][10]) and put
Echofon, a free app from the App Store, on your iPhone. Echofon makes
tweeting from your iPhone easy, so that you'll tweet a lot.  
  
Then, use [TwitterFeed][11] or something like it to feed your blog posts
to Twitter and Facebook. Your web site designer will have to put an RSS
or Atom feed on your blog. Once that's done, you can set up TwitterFeed
yourself. If you don't want to, your web site designer should be able to
help you. And if they can't, I'll help you.  
  
Add "Follow me on Twitter" and "Tweet this" icons and text on your web
site (meaning your blog). Your web site designer will have to do that.
The first makes it easy for people to follow you. The second makes it
easy for people to publicize your site -- free publicity!  
  
Get yourself a [YouTube][12] account. Post clips of yourself with some
commentary about why you like the clip. Put links back to your site in
the YouTube comment, and blog about the video link and embed the video
in your blog (as you've done already with other people's work). If you
want some help editing videos, let me know.   
  
Finally, start reading [Seth Godin's blog][13]. Seth is the original
marketing brain of the Internet age and he's an incredible generator of
ideas. I find reading his blog overwhelming, but if you take even one of
his ideas and implement it you're way ahead of everyone else.   
  
Now, about search engine optimization. I'm no expert, but I've heard
from reliable sources that Google and the other big search engines put a
lot of effort into preventing people from "gaming" search results. It
makes sense. People won't use a search engine if they don't get the
answers they really want. So Google does a lot to make sure that your
rank is based on people who found your site useful. That's why real
traffic from real people is the best way to rise up in the search engine
ranks.  
  
Most search engine optimization techniques already don't work. What I
mean is that every time someone comes up with a new trick, Google and
the others find a way to filter it out. No search engine optimization
"expert" that you and I can afford to hire is likely to know how to
outsmart Google. And even if he does today, you'll find that next month
Google has neutralized the trick.  
  
If you really want to get someone to do search engine optimization, ask
if they'll agree to be paid based on the sustained additional growth in
traffic they provide to your site. It will take some work to come up
with a fair formula, but you have the raw data you need since you're
using Google Analystics. Really, if someone isn't confident they can
produce results for you, why should *you* be confident they can produce
results?  
  
I hope this helps. Let me know what you think.

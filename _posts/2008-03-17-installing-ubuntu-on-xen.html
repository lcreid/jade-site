I was able to install Ubuntu 6.06.1 on Xen by putting the Ubuntu install CD in the CD drive of the Xen server. I got lost for a while because I didn't create the storage when initially setting up the VM. Once I actually made a disk, the install went okay. I've found a post saying that <a href="http://forums.xensource.com/message.jspa?messageID=10310">Ubuntu will start having errors and switch the disk to read-only</a>, so I'll watch for that.<br /><br />I still need to install the Xen tools...

I'm not a network expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I've&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;solved problems by poking around a bit with <a href="http://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>.<br /><br />Of course, if my network is down I'm not going to be able to download Wireshark. Fortunately, I remembered to re-install Wireshark on my new computer <i>before</i>&nbsp;I needed it. I installed it using the Ubuntu Software Centre.<br /><br />A new feature of Wireshark that I didn't know about: If you add yourself to the "wireshark" group, you can do live captures without running Wireshark as root.<br /><br /><code>sudo adduser --disabled-login --disabled-password wireshark<br />sudo chgrp wireshark /usr/bin/dumpcap<br />sudo chmod 754 /usr/bin/dumpcap<br />sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' /usr/bin/dumpcap<br /></code><br /><br />Now add yourself to the wireshark group and log out. When you log back in you should be able to do live captures without root privileges. To add yourself to the wireshark group in a terminal, type:<br /><br /><code>adduser <i>your-user-name</i>&nbsp;wireshark<br /></code><br /> The Wireshark documentation for this is <a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/CapturePrivileges">here</a> (scroll down a bit).

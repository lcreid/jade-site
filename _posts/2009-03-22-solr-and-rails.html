Well, after some long diversions I have Solr working in some simple test cases with Rails. The long diversion was partly caused by not understanding what was offered by the Rails Solr plug-in, so I'm going to give an overview here, and a link to detailed instructions for Solr in Rails at the end of this post.<br /><br />The Rails plug-in for Solr from git:<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">//</span>github.com<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">/</span>mattmatt<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">/</span>acts_as_solr.git includes a complete installation of Solr. You don't need to install Solr separately. (My "long diversion" is that I rushed off and installed Solr separately, and spent a fair bit of time getting it running due to my ignorance of how it worked.)<br /><br />If you want to index Word, Excel, PDF, and other types of documents, there is a bit of additional configuration to do. To index those files types you have to get a nightly build of Solr from <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/lucene/solr/nightly/">here</a>, and copy some files and directories as described in the link at the end of this post. You have to add the following lines to example/solr/conf/solrconf.xml:<br /><pre>  &lt;requestHandler name="/update/extract" class="org.apache.solr.handler.extraction.ExtractingRequestHandler"&gt;<br />    &lt;lst name="defaults"&gt;<br />      &lt;str name="ext.map.Last-Modified"&gt;last_modified&lt;/str&gt;<br />      &lt;bool name="ext.ignore.und.fl"&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;<br />    &lt;/lst&gt;<br />    &lt;/requestHandler&gt;</pre>The plug-in also includes rake tasks to start and stop instances of the Solr server for development, test and production -- very handy. Just type <pre>rake solr:start RAILS_ENV=test </pre>to start the test Solr server (default environment is development). It also gives you a yaml file in your environment directory to configure the ports that each instance of Solr will use (as installed: production on 8983, test on 8981 and development on 8982).<br /><br />One thing I learned on my diversion is that Solr comes with an administration user interface that shows how many documents are in the Solr database, and lets you try ad-hoc queries. It's a good way to test if Solr is actually running. For example, after running the rake task to start Solr for development, you can browse to localhost:8982/solr/admin and you should get the Solr administration page.<br /><br />So that's the overview. The detailed write up is <a href="http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2009/02/17/acts_as_solr_cell/">here</a>. It's good. I just wish I had this overview first so I knew what I was getting and where I was going.

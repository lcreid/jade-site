It's interesting how [NEC's press release][1]{:
onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;"} on their new storage
devices spends so much time talking about how they do non-disruptive
upgrades and scale across the whole product line. We had trouble with
upgrades and scaling our storage at Vancouver Coastal Health. The NEC
press release validates that we're not the only ones. I don't have
experience with NEC storage devices, so I can't comment on them. I'm
only commenting on the press release.

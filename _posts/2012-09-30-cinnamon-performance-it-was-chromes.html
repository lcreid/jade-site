I've written lately about my struggles with sluggish Ubuntu and Mint desktops. Finally, I discovered that <a href="http://technopragmatica.blogspot.ca/2012/09/ubuntu-and-mint-very-slow.html" target="_blank">Chrome was the problem</a>. At one point in my ramblings, I recommended <a href="http://technopragmatica.blogspot.ca/2012/09/use-mate-with-cheap-hardware.html" target="_blank">using Mate instead of Cinnamon</a>. Well, I'm happy to report that my slow Dell Vostro 1440 runs Cinnamon just fine, as long as I'm not running Chrome.

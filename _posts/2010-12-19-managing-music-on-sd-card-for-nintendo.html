I wanted to manage music on an SD card, as that's the way a Nintendo DS gets its music. I wanted my son to have his music on his DS so he didn't have to keep track of and charge an MP3 player and a DS.<br /><br />First, Rhythmbox on Ubuntu 10.04 wouldn't recognize the SD card. Fortunately, I'd stumbled across the solution to that a few weeks ago: put a file called ".is_audio_player" in the root of the SD card.<br /><br />However, it still wouldn't copy m4a files over. The DS only plays m4a files, not mp3. I discovered that you can actually put content in the .is_audio_player file to control the behaviour of Rhythmbox. It was still hard to figure out what to put in, but finally I looked up what Rhythmbox uses to manage an iPod, and put this in the .is_audio_player file:<br /><br /><pre><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">folder_depth=99<br />output_formats=audio/mpeg,audio/aac,audio/x-wav,audio/x-aiff</span></pre><br />Worked a charm after that.<br /><br />P.S. My son's doing some serious scratch with the Police on his DS right now.

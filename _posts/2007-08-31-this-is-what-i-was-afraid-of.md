Part of the reason I started blogging was because I was "between
contracts" as we say. I never seemed to have time to write when I was
working full time and trying to have a life. Sure enough, I've posted
three times, including this, since I got my current contract.  
  
Who cares? Well, one of the reasons we get things so wrong in IT is that
technology doesn't do what we were told it does. One of the great things
about the Internet is that it's given us access to people who are
actually using technology, so we can solve problems faster. Blogging,
however, demands a certain level of time to blog, which is taking away
from your time doing.  
  
The bottom line: There's useful stuff in blogs, but you have to filter
out the rantings from the useful information yourself.

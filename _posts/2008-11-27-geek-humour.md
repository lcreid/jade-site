Two jokes that are just so impossibly geeky that I have to repeat them.
My apologies if they're so old you've seen them already.  
<blockquote>There are 10 types of people in this world: Those who
understand binary numbers and those who don't.</blockquote>And  
<blockquote>Heisenberg is speeding down the highway and is pulled over
by the police. The officer comes up to his window and says, "Do you know
how fast you were going sir?" Heisenberg replies, "No. But I know where
I am."</blockquote>Ba-da-bing.

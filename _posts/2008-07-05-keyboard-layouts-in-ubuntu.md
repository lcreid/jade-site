I type enough in Spanish that I like to be able to switch keyboard
layouts between English and Spanish, rather than type Alt-whatever to
get the Spanish characters (e.g. ñ, ¡, ¿).  
  
In Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy), go to System--> Administration--> Language
Support and install Spanish. This requires a reboot. Truth be told, I'm
not sure you have to do this step just to get the keyboard layout, but
if you type enough in a language that you want the keyboard layout, you
probably want the rest of the language support as well.  
  
To install control over the keyboard layout:  
<ol><li>Right-click on the top panel (aka menu bar, aka tool bar) and
select "Add to Panel..."</li><li>Select "Keyboard Indicator". You'll see
the indicator appear in the panel. In my case, it said
"USA"</li><li>Right click on the indicator and select "Keyboard
Preferences"</li><li>Select the "Layouts" tab</li><li>Click the "Add..."
button</li><li>Select the keyboard layout you want. For those looking
for Spanish, note that there's a layout for Spain and a layout called
"Latin American". The keyboard I bought in Guatemala is actually the
"Spanish" layout. You'll have to figure out what works for you  
</li><li>Click OK until you're back to what you wanted to be doing  
</li></ol>Of course, that doesn't change the physical keycaps. When
you're using the Latin American layout with a USA keyboard, it's
sometimes hard to find some of the special characters. They're not in
the same place on the two keyboards. Fortunately, we have yet another
nice advantage of Ubuntu over Windows. You can right-click on the
keyboard indicator and select "Show Current Layout" and it gives you a
picture of your keyboard. You can even print the layout.

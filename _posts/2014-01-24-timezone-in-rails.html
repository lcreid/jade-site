There’s pretty good info out there about using time zones in Rails, and Rails itself does a lot of the heavy lifting. The <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/106-time-zones-revised">Railscast</a> pretty much covers it. It’s only missing a discussion of using Javascript to figure out the client browser’s time zone.<br /><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div><h1 id="time-zone-from-the-browser">Time Zone from the Browser</h1>To get the time zone from the browser, use the <a href="https://github.com/scottwater/detect_timezone_rails">detect_timezone_rails</a> gem. The instructions give you what you need to know to set up a form with an input field that will return the time zone that the browser figured out. That would work perfectly if you were implementing a traditional web site sign-up/sign-in form.<br />However, I needed to do something different. Since I’m using third party identity providers (Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) via the excellent <a href="http://intridea.github.io/omniauth/">Omniauth</a> gems, I needed to be able to put the time zone as a parameter on the URL of the identity provider’s authorization request. Omniauth arranges for that parameter to come back from the identity provider, so it’s available to my app’s controller when I set up the session.<br />To add the parameter, I added this jQuery script to the head of the welcome page:<br /><pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;<br />  $(document).ready(function(){<br />        $('a.time_zone')<br />          .each(function() {<br />            this.href = this.href + "?time_zone=" +<br />              encodeURIComponent($().get_timezone());<br />      });<br />  });<br />&lt;/script&gt;<br /></code></pre>This added the time zone, appropriately escaped, to the URL for the identity provider (the href of the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements). This worked because I had set each of the links to the identity providers to have <code>class="time_zone"</code>, like this:<br /><pre><code>&lt;div class="idp"&gt;<br />  &lt;%= link_to image_tag("sign-in-with-twitter-link.png", alt: "Twitter"), <br />    "/auth/twitter", <br />    class: "time_zone" %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br /></code></pre>In the controller, I did this (along with all the other logging in stuff):<br /><pre><code>if env["omniauth.params"] &amp;&amp;<br />  env["omniauth.params"]["time_zone"]<br />  tz = Rack::Utils.unescape(env["omniauth.params"]["time_zone"])<br />  if user.time_zone.blank? <br />    user.time_zone = tz<br />    user.save!<br />    flash.notice = "Your time zone has been set to #{user.time_zone}." +<br />      " If this is wrong," +<br />      " please click #{view_context.link_to('here', edit_user_path(user))}" +<br />      " to change your profile."<br />  elsif user.time_zone != tz<br />    flash.notice = "It appears you are now in the #{tz} time zone. " +<br />      "Please click #{view_context.link_to(edit_user_path(user), 'here')}" +<br />      " if you want to change your time zone."<br />  end<br />else<br />  logger.error("#{user.name} (id: #{user.id}) logged in with no time zone from browser.")<br />end      <br /></code></pre>Of course, you may want to do something different in your controller.<br /><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div><h1 id="testing-time-zones">Testing Time Zones</h1>However you get your time zones, you need to be testing your app to see how it works with different time zones. YAML, at least for a Rails fixture, interprets something that looks like a date or time as UTC. So by default, that’s what you’re testing with. But that might not be the best thing.<br />I had read that a good trick for testing is to pick a time zone that isn’t the one your computer is in. Finding such a time zone might be hard if you have contributors around the world. I like the Samoa time zone for testing: Far away from UTC, not too many people living in the time zone, and it has DST.<br />If you want a particular time zone in your fixtures, you have to use ERB. For example, in my fixtures I might put this:<br /><pre><code>created_at: &lt;%= Time.find_zone('Samoa').parse('2014-01-30T12:59:43.1') %&gt;<br /></code></pre>And in the test files, something like this:<br /><pre><code>test "routines layout" do<br />  Time.zone = 'Samoa'<br />  correct_hash = {<br />    routines(:routine_index_one)=&gt; {<br />      Time.zone.local(2014, 01, 30)=&gt; [<br />        completed_routines(:routine_index_one_one)<br />      ],<br />      ...<br /></code></pre><div class="se-section-delimiter"></div><h1 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h1>I found a few gotchas that I hadn’t seen mentioned elsewhere:<br /><ul><li>Rails applies the time zone magic when it queries the database, so if you change your time zone after you retrieve the data, then you have to force a requery, or the cached times will still be in the model. Shouldn’t be a problem when running tests, but is when using the console to figure things out</li><li>You can’t use database functions to turn times into dates, as these won’t use the time zone. No <code>group by to_date(...)</code> or anything like that</li></ul>

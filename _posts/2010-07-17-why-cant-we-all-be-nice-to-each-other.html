Wouldn't technical forums, technical blogs, etc. be nicer to read if people restricted their value judgements and opinions to their own behaviour, rather than other people's behaviour? Doing so might eliminate a lot of unnecessary flaming.<br /><br />To be really clear, I'm not saying there's no place for opinions on the Internet. I'm just saying technical forums aren't the place for me to express my opinions about what someone else is doing. If someone wants help with an old version of the Linux kernel, I should either help or shut up. There's no need for me to give my own opinions on the wisdom of using old kernels.

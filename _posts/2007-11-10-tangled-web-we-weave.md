I'm currently dealing with people who want to buy a technology that's
flexible and can do all sorts of things that they don't currently need
it to do. This is slowing up the project, and causing them a lot of
stress.  
  
The technology we buy today will be obsolete in five years (if it lasts
that long). So by the time you want to do something more with the
existing technology, you'll be able to do it better and cheaper with
whatever is on the market at that time, not what you bought three years
ago. Why should you pay extra for features that you're not going to use
until the equipment is half way or more through its useful life?  
  
If your organization is of any reasonable size, the real cost of doing
something new with technology is the training and organizational change,
not the capital cost of the equipment. You may want to take advantage of
those features you paid for two years ago, but you still can't afford to
because of the training costs for staff.  
  
The idea that we have to buy for future unknown needs, not just what we
need now is pervasive in IT. Perhaps it's because we're always
overpromising what we can deliver. When we deliver and the customer is
unhappy we beat ourselves up for not buying (overspending) on all the
extra features so we get the one the user really wants. It's time to
stop over promising.

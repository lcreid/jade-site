The <a href="http://www.plantronics.com/ca/search/index.jsp?term=m165+marque+2">Plantronics M165 Marque 2</a> Bluetooth headset paired very nicely with my Android phone. To pair it to my computer running Linux Mint 17 I:<br /><ol><li>Clicked on the Bluetooth icon</li><li>Turned on Bluetooth</li><li>Clicked “Set up a new device…”</li><li>Pressed and held the Call button on the headset for five or six seconds, until the computer found the headset (the Plantronics documentation is <a href="http://www.plantronics.com/ca/support/kb/detail.jsp?vfurl=/articles/en_US/How_To/RN17509&amp;p=&amp;c=Mobile_Cordless&amp;k=pair%20with%20computer&amp;t=How_To__kav&amp;lang=en_US&amp;popup=false">here</a>)</li></ol>The sound test in the Sound Settings dialogue didn’t sound right, but I could play music through the headset and it sounded recognizable.<br />Using it with Skype gave super-sucky sound quality. Lowering the PCM level in <code>alsamixer</code> to about 70 made the sound quality a lot better, but still not great (lowering the PCM level was suggested <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-2192627/poor-linux-sound-quality-driver-issue.html">here</a>).<br /><code>alsamixer</code> is a command-line application. Open a Terminal and type: <code>alsamixer</code>, then use the left and right arrow keys to find “PCM”, and use the up and down arrow keys to set the level.<br />Still trying to improve the sound quality, I noticed that the built-in microphone is on when the headset is on. On a Skype test call, manually turning off the microphone didn’t seem to make a lot of difference to the sound quality.<br />Using Audacity to record sound, the quality of the built-in microphone was even worse than the headset.<br />[Edit] Using the headset, I made a Skype call to my son, and he said the quality of my voice was okay. I could also hear him okay.<br />In case you need to know, the Bluetooth config files are in <code>/etc/bluetooth</code>.

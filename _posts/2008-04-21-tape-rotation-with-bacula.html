I love the topic of backups. I say that because it's <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">IT's</span> dirty secret. No one should keep data in one place only, yet it's very difficult to set up a backup solution. Different organizations have different needs, and so backup software has to provide a lot of options. But the need for options means when you just want to get basic backup running quickly, it's a challenge.<br /><br />This post is part of a series about rolling your own backup solution. There are other ways to do it, but I wanted to do my own solution one more time...<br /><br />I'm backing up a Windows <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">XP</span> desktop and a Windows <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">XP</span> laptop, a Dell SC440 which is the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">VMWare</span> host, plus a number of Linux <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">VMs</span> that provide my basic infrastructure: <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">DNS</span>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">DHCP</span>, file server, Subversion server, test platforms for software development, and the backup server itself.<br /><br />I chose tape in part because I can take the backup off-site. I'll take a tape off-site once a week. That means I might lose a week's worth of work if my house burns down, but I'm not ready to invest in the time and effort to swap tapes every day, either.<br /><br />The <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">Bacula</span> documentation has a good section on <a href="http://www.bacula.org/en/rel-manual/Backup_Strategies.html">backup strategies</a>, but none of them include mine. I'll have to figure it out myself.<br /><br /><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">Bacula</span> manages tapes in a <a href="http://www.bacula.org/en/rel-manual/Getting_Started_with_Bacula.html#SECTION00920000000000000000">tape pool</a>. A pool is just a group of tapes. (<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">Bacula</span> calls tapes "volumes".) I want to let <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">Bacula</span> fill up one tape per week before it uses another, which is the default behaviour. At the end of the week, I want to eject the tape and use another. I'll let <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">Bacula</span> <a href="http://www.bacula.org/en/rel-manual/Automatic_Volume_Recycling.html#RecyclingChapter">automatically recycle</a> the tapes, meaning that after a week (in my case), <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">Bacula</span> will reuse a tape, overwriting the old backups on it.<br /><br />Anyway, I started with a rotation to do a full backup Sunday night, incremental backups all week, and then eject the tape Saturday night after the last incremental. With three tapes I would always have last week's tape off site, except on Sunday.<br /><br />I really only got started when I realized that that's a lot of tape wear given that the off-site happens once a week and that I have a fair bit of disk space on my main server. So my next idea is:<br /><br />Take a full backup Monday night to disk, and <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">incrementals</span> up to Sunday night. Then, Monday morning write the whole disk volume to tape and take it off-site. That way I only run the tape once a week, and hopefully in a scenario that minimizes the chance of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_drive">shoe-shining</a>. I'll write the data to disk without compression, and let hardware compression compress the data to tape.<br /><br />This also has the nice property that last week's backups are also on the disk (if I have enough disk space), so if I need a file I can get it from disk rather than retrieving the tape.

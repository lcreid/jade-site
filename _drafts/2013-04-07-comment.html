I've used bacula for about five years to back up various Linux machines, and for a while, some Windows ones. When I started, I used tape and wanted to back up Windows, and bacula was the most mature open-source solution I could find. For backups one thing you really want is a solution that's been truly tried and tested.<br /><br />(One thing that always makes me chuckle is that the computer industry calls this challenge "backup", when the real reason we do it is so we can restore files when we have a problem. You run backups every night for a year. You run a restore once a year. Are you sure the restore will work when you need it?)<br /><br />I've struggled a lot with bacula over the years. It's pretty heavy-weight for what I wanted. I wasn't doing backups as a full-time job. I was just trying to keep my own and my family's files safe. I found it runs just fine, rock stable and reliable, until something unexpected happens. That can be running out of space on the backup device, or as simple as turning off the computer before the backup is finished. Once things got a bit off the rails, it took non-trivial effort on my part to get things back to running smoothly.<br /><br />I probably wasn't using all the features of bacula that I could have been using. Almost certainly there's a lot more there than there was five years ago when I started. The bacula documentation is great reference documentation, but not good at giving simple cookbook solutions. Learning something new with bacula was always a huge effort for me. I felt if I'm going to invest the effort to learn new bacula features, perhaps I could better spend the effort learning something else.<br /><br />A few brief Google sessions showed lots of options, if I were prepared to be Linux-specific. That's okay for me now (although I would like to support Mac in the near future). A lot seem to be focused on home directory backups only. I do enough messing with my system config files that I wanted something I could almost do a bare metal restore from -- at least look up the config file from earlier.<br /><br />Andrew, the guy who knows more about computers than anyone, <a href="http://thesoftwarelife.blogspot.ca/2010/11/giving-up-on-amanda.html">rolled his own backup</a> a few years ago. Both he and I are pretty strong believers in don't roll your own when someone else does the job well enough. His thinking was that it was simpler to roll your own than to learn someone else's.<br /><br />So I'm going to go down that path. Here I describe what I want to do, and here I describe how I did it.<br /><br />

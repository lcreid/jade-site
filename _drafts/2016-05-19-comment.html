So I bought a laptop from System76. The ordering and deliver process was pretty good. The goofy way they validate your credit card was a bit unsettling. With all the payment options available today, why do they do their own?<br /><br />Anyway, all is good and the computer crosses national borders and is delivered two days after assembly. Total time order to deliver: Less that 7 days (as in 7 X 24 hours).<br /><br />However, almost immediately, Ubuntu 16.04 caused grief. I've been using Mint for over two years now, and I'm reminded why. Why should it be a pain in the ass to install Chrome on Ubuntu? Because installing third-party packages isn't important enough to Shuttleworth, et. al., to test before release of a long-term support version. Or they test but they don't give a shit about the result of the test.<br /><br />Honestly, I fully expected to be installing Mint as soon as Mint 18 came out, but I was prepared to give Ubuntu on the desktop a chance again. But the time wasted installing Chrome sealed Ubuntu's fate right off the bat: It will be completely erased from this machine the minute the new Mint is available.<br /><br />[Why do I want to install Chrome instead of Firefox? Because I don't care how "pure" your open source ethos is, if you abuse your employees with almost-criminal incompetence. Did you hear that, Mozilla? No. Yeah, well not listening is one of the ways you abuse your employees.]<br /><br />Back to the real stuff:<br /><ol><li>Install Chrome: You can't let the Google website walk you through it, because Shuttlewoth doesn't want the Chrome install to be easy. So you have to `apt-get install gdebi` first, then do a simple download of Chrome, then use `gdebi` to install it</li><li>Install Atom: Same deal. Just download it, then open the ".deb" file with `gdebi`</li><li>Git was already installed at this point</li><li>`sudo apt-get install virtualbox`</li></ol><div>The next bit of stupidity I discovered is that the power management wasn't set up to sleep by default when the lid closed, or shut itself down when the power was low. Even though the power setting said they were set that way. Maybe it doesn't know when the lid is closed?</div><div><ol><li>Next installed Skype. Had to download manually and use `gdebi` again, as it isn't in the Ubuntu software centre</li><li>`apt-get install icedtea-plugin`</li><li>`sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras`</li><li>Tried installing Citrix Receiver, but there's more to it than just download and install</li><li>Copied all my files from the old laptop via `rsync`</li><li>Back to Citrix. You need to allow the file to download, then click on it in the bottom bar and select "always open files of this type". But more than that, you need to download the right certificate, as it seems the Entrust root authority certificate isn't available to Chrome.&nbsp;</li><li>I downloaded `sudo curl -o entrust_2048_ca.cer https://www.entrust.com/root-certificates/entrust_2048_ca.cer` into `/opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts`, but I already had that certificate</li><li>After I `sudo curl -o Entrust_CA-L1k.cer https://ocio.nih.gov/Smartcard/Documents/Certificates/Entrust_CA-L1k.cer` into `/opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts`,&nbsp;and then imported it into Chrome (Settings, Advanced, Manage Certificates, Servers, Import, blah blah blah, it all works</li></ol><br /><br /></div>

Right now this is just a list of things to consider when someone asks you to install Ubuntu on their computer:<br /><ul><li>Get the make, model, CPU speed, RAM installed and disk size. Check it against the recommended minimums for the current release of Ubuntu, and check the hardware compatability page (especially for laptops)</li><li>Find out the graphics chip and Google or search Launchpad for issues, especially if it's an older chip</li><li>Find out if they want to save any work they have on the computer</li><li>As what they'll be doing with the computer. Are they using any special hardware or software. For example, some of the most popular language learning systems come with hardware and software that only works on Windows (or Mac if you buy the Mac version)</li><li>Find out what kind of network they'll be hooking to. Check the NIC for compatability (although I haven't had problems with NICs for a couple of years)</li><li>After installing, do an update. This takes a fair bit of time (overnight)</li><li>Set up Open Office to default to saving as Microsoft format documents (Word, Excel)</li></ul>

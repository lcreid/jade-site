Once again struggling with the disappearing VMWare management interface...<br /><br />I found a post somewhere that said delete /etc/vmware/hostd/authorization.xml and then try to log in again. VMWare recreated the file all right, but then I couldn't log in as the VMWare management user. It wanted me to log in as root. But when I copied the old file back, all was good.<br /><br />I can't find the original post. <br /><br />Googling the file with path gets lots of interesting posts.<br /><br />I can't find the original.

A data centre relocation is really a network project. I say that because the things that actually change are network related: Internal and external IPs of devices, and therefore DNS, firewall rules, etc.<br /><br />A few strategies have made a major difference in the cost and effort, or the number of unplanned outages.<br /><br />First and foremost, you need to understand how to map the network at the existing data centre to the new one. If you do this, then assigning an IP in the new data centre can be done simply by knowing the old IP, and looking up in a spreadsheet how to map to the new IP.<br /><br />In addition&nbsp; <br /><br />In a number of data centre moves I've been involved in, servers in the DMZ didn't use DNS. <br /><br /><ul><li>No DNS, host files</li><li>Firewalls, proxies, NAT</li></ul>

Moving a data centre isn't rocket science, but since you don't do it every day, it's risky. The good thing is you can find consultants who've done it before.<br /><br />I think what distinguishes the really good relocation consultants from the average is the degree to which they understand your organization. Like many things in IT, the "best practices" are really situation specific. The best consultants will learn about your organization and recognize what applies for you.

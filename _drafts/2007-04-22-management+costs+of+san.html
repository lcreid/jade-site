A final advantage typically mentioned for SAN-attached storage is the reduced management cost. It's hard not to think that centrally managed storage would be better. However, the line managers who staff the storage management and server admin positions won't offer to give up any staff when they buy SAN-attached storage. In fact, they'll say they need to send people on training, and they'll tell you that you can't just send any server admin on the training course. You need to have your best people working with SAN. The reality is that pretty much any server admin can add direct-attached disk to a server and move the data around.

title: 10 Things Your Deliver
---

1. On time
2. Accept feedback
3. Flexibility -- open to suggestions and feedback
4. Adaptability -- when needs change, we respond quickly
5. Focus on the customer -- we don't have to deliver anything to
manager or shareholders
6. Creativity -- we've been around long enough to be able to give
useful input of our own in solving problems
8. Flexibility -- we're not beholden to anyone's pre-existing ideas
about how something should be done,
or with what tools it should be done
9. Value for money -- no big overhead to pay for marketing or managers
10. Low risk -- no up front commitment for us or our tools

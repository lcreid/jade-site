# What Do People Buy
Excellent software.
Software that's easy to learn,
easy to use,
doesnt' waste people's time.

When someone buys from me,
they get someone who listens to the business problem
and genuinely tries to solve it.
They get someone who's prepared to do the hard work
to figure out where the gaps are,
and to fill in those gaps.

We test thoroughly,
with automated tests that are consistent and repeatable.
We build and deploy with repeatable,
automated processes.
We show you working software.

# What are we doing that's difficult
Really learning how the business works.
Listening.
Take the perspective of the user.

    <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Virtualization</span> solves lots of problems for many if not most organizations that have more than a rack of servers. On an earlier assignment I calculated a worst-case saving of C$380 per month for a virtual server over a physical server (using <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">ESX</span> 2.5 and 3.0 from <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">VMWare</span>). But there's a catch to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">virtualization</span>, and that catch is backups.<br /><br /><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Virtualization</span> introduces wrinkles on your backup approach. Fortunately, to start off you're probably okay doing your backups the same way you always have been. The backup wrinkles are not enough to stop you from embarking on <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">virtualization</span>.<br /><br />Here are some of the things you need to watch for as you add virtual machines (<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">VMs</span>) to your <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">virtualization</span> platform:<br /><ul><li>Do you have highly-tuned start and stop times for your backup jobs, for example when you have inter-dependencies between external events and your backup jobs? </li><li>Do the servers you plan to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">virtualize</span> have file server-like data, in other words, does it consist of a lot of small files that mostly don't change?<br /></li><li>If you had a fire in your data centre today, before <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">virtualizing</span>, how soon would you have to have all the servers rebuilt?</li><li>Is your backup infrastructure really only being used to half capacity or less?</li></ul>If you have highly tuned backup schedules, you need to consider how <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">virtualization</span> may mess up those schedules. Your backup performance may actually improve early on. This happens when you <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">virtualize</span> a lot of old servers that have slow disks and/or network cards. Your <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">virtualization</span> platform probably has <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">gigabit</span> network and may be attached to fast disk (e.g. a fibre channel SAN). The solution is simple: watch your backup jobs as you <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">virtualize</span> physical servers and make adjustments as needed.<br /><br />As you add <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">VMs</span> to your infrastructure, you may run into decreasing backup performance. The reason: many servers today are at their busiest during their backup. You may be able to run 20 <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">VMs</span> comfortably on one physical server, but if you try to back up all those <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17">VMs</span> at once you'll run into bottlenecks because the physical server has a certain number of network interfaces, and all the data is coming from the same storage device, or at least through the same storage interface. Again, the solution is to watch backup performance as you <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">virtualize</span> and make adjustments.<br /><br />Be aware that you might have to make changes to your backup infrastructure to deal with real challenges of backup performance introduced by <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19">virtualization</span>. If your backups are already a problem, you might want to look into this in more detail. (The problems and solutions are beyond the scope of this post.)<br /><br />How long do you have to rebuild servers after a data centre fire? You may not have even thought of the problem (don't be embarrassed. Many of us haven't). With <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">virtualization</span> you have to think about it because an equivalent event is more likely to happen: The storage device that holds all your <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">VMs</span> may lose its data, and you're faced with rebuilding all your <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22">VMs</span>. I have second-hand experience (e.g. the guys down the street) with storage devices eating all the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_23">VMs</span>, but I've never directly known anyone who had a serious fire in the data centre.<br /><br />If the backups on your physical servers can be restored to bare metal, then you don't have to worry about your storage device eating the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_24">VMs</span>. You may have to make some changes to your bare-metal backup -- I have no experience with that topic so I don't know for sure -- but once you do you should be able to restore your <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_25">VMs</span> relatively quickly.<br /><br />If you can't or don't have backups that can be restored to bare metal, then you have a challenge. I doubt that most general purpose data centres are full of identically configured servers, with detailed rebuild procedures and air-tight configuration management so every server can be rebuilt exactly like the one that was running before. If you had to rebuild 200 <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_26">VMs</span> from installation disks, you'd probably be working a lot of long nights.<br /><br />If most of your servers that you plan to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_27">virtualize</span> have database-like data (large files that change every day), I'd recommend looking at changing your backup approach for those servers to a product like <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_28">ESX</span> Ranger, or look for some of the user-built solutions on the Internet. These products will back up the entire virtual machine every time they run, and may not allow individual file (within the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_29">VM</span>) restores. However, for a database server you're probably backing up the whole server every night anyway, so that won't be a significant change to your backup workload.<br /><br />If you want to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_30">virtualize</span> file server-like servers, there isn't really a good solution that I or anyone I know has found at this time. If your backup infrastructure has enough room to take the additional load, simply back up with <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_31">ESX</span> Ranger or one of the other solutions once a week (or however frequently you do a full backup), along with your current full and incremental backup schedule. If you have to rebuild the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_32">VM</span>, you restore the most recent <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_33">ESX</span> Ranger backup first. If you just have to restore files on the server, because a user deleted an important document, for example, just use the regular backups.<br /><br />If you have the budget to change backup infrastructures, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_34">ESX</span> Ranger can probably provide a pretty good overall solution. However, you have to provide backup and restore for physical servers as well, so the staff who do restores have to be able to deal with two backup systems.<br /><br />One final gotcha that I've run across: There are some great devices out there from companies like Data Domain that provide excellent compression of exactly the type of data you're backing up when you back up an entire <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_35">VM</span>. Unfortunately, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_36">ESX</span> Ranger compresses the data too, which messes up the storage device's compression. Whatever solution you put together, make sure your vendor commits to performance targets based on the entire solution, not on individual products.<br /><br />As with so much of what we do in IT, it's really hard to summarize everything in a way that makes sense in a blog post. Comment on this post if you'd like more details or reasons why I make the recommendations I make.

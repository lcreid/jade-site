<h1 id="what-do-we-do">What Do We Do</h1>
<p>We want to show people
that software
can make their life better,
without the costs
risks,
and frustrations
traditionally associated
with custom software development.
We want people
to get a big smile on their face
when they use our software,
because it does what they want.</p>

<h1 id="who-do-we-want-to-change">Who Do We Want to Change</h1>
<p>We want to change the minds
of business decision makers.
For too long,
custom software has been thought to be too expensive and risky.
Times have changed,
and the modern sharing economy in the software world
means that small teams
can build professional software,
at a reasonable cost,
and with low risk.</p>

<h1 id="how-much-are-we-willing-to-risk">How Much Are We Willing to Risk</h1>
<p>We’re 8 out of 10 on the risk.
We believe you should pay us when you start seeing benefit from our work.</p>

<h1 id="how-much-work-am-i-willing-to-do">How Much Work Am I Willing to Do</h1>
<p>When it’s time to work, we work hard.
Work time should be filled with activities that move you forward,
towards your goals.
We all work for a reason.
Family comes first.
Personal health and well-being is next.
Fulfilled people do the best work.</p>

<h1 id="does-this-project-matter-enough">Does This Project Matter Enough</h1>
<p>It really bothers me that people
spend tonnes of money on software,
and get no value for it.
At the same time,
so many things could be easier
or possible with software,
but it’s too risky and expensive
to develop the software to do the job.</p>

<h1 id="has-anyone-done-this-before">Has Anyone Done This Before</h1>
<p>Lots of people have started small software development companies.</p>
